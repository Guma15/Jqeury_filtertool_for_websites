# Jquery_filtertool_for_websites

Simple jquery filter function that can be used for websites with news/blog posts etc.

It makes use of css classes to hide and show divs with related class names. What the jquery scripts does is remove/add these classes using addClass()/removeClass()."

Use at free will, just give some cred.
